My Role Model is my mother, she is a pilot and she flies high in the sky. Really it is amazing and I always want to be like her. I learn a lot from her and I obey her because I believe that if I will do all that she says, one day I can also be like her. She is a mother, a pilot, a driver, a cook, a good person, all at the same time. I not only want to be a pilot like her but want to copy her overall personality.

I like her discipline, although she is a working person, she manages everything in such a great way that even my friend’s parents praise her. I have seen many of my friend’s homes badly managed; but she has given us training in such a way that even my younger brother keeps his belongings properly.

She is also a very good cook and she also tries various recipes and we get the restaurant food at home. She learned cooking after her marriage and today she is one of the best and I bet she can also be a Master Chef. Really, an amazing personality and a lot to learn.

Her sense of fashion, she believes if a person is busy, they should carry a style as per their schedule, like if you have very little time then go for a messy look, with a watch and a loose siphon fabric and a messy hairstyle.

I can’t mention a field where she is imperfect, really not only I, others also learn from her. Actually, she never gets disappointed and never ponders on the past. It is a very good thing and one should definitely imply this in their lives.

Luckily, I got my inspiration at my home. She is my mother, mentor, a very good friend, etc. But all in one she is an amazing personality and a role model for all of us. I wish I could become at least a bit like her. I never get disappointed because she is always with me to take care of me and also encourages me to do something different. All of us learn from different people and she is one of them. Apart from her I also want to appreciate my teacher and friends who also play a very important role in motivating me.
